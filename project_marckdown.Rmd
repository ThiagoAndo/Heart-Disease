#Introduction

Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. As reported by World Health Organization (WHO), Heart Disease and Stroke are the world’s biggest killers and have remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years. 

Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decisions and predictions. Machine Learning can present remarkable features that simplify the identification of unseen patterns, eventually providing clinical insights that assist physicians in planning and providing care.  In this analysis, the presence of heart disease is predicted by employing Logistic regression and Tree Based Models.

# Data cleaning and pre-processing

There were no duplicate entries in the and no missing values the table below gives a summary of these:
```{r}
paste0("There are ",sum(duplicated(heart_named)), " duplicate observations") 

# The skim  providing a strong set of summary statistics that are generated for a variety of different data types.
skim(heart_named)
```



</br></br>





# Problem Statements
Performing analysis of Heart Disease dataset both visually and statistically to obtain important observations that can be used for inference. Build a model having high accuracy and precision to predict whether a person has heart disease with greater confidence.


</br></br>



#Data Analysis



```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 1'}
ggplot(heart_named, aes(x=condition, fill=condition)) + 
   geom_bar(stat="count") +
   geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = 1.5, colour = "white",
             fontface = "bold",size = 7)+
   theme_minimal() +
   scale_fill_manual(values =c("#808080", "#B3B6B7"))+
   ggtitle("Count of Presence and Absence of Heart Disease") +
   xlab("Heart Disease") +
   ylab("Count")+
   theme(
      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
      axis.text.x =  element_text(size = 15, color="black") ,
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 17),
                                
      legend.position = "none") 

```
 
 However, this data set is small, it is well distributed between the outcomes. We can check on the bar chart that roughly 46% of the outcome tested positive for heart disease. This will help the precision of the algorithm in predicting heart disease.  
 
</br>

```{r,fig.cap = 'Figure 2'}
  
ggplot(heart_named, aes(sex, fill = sex))+
   geom_bar(stat="count") +
   geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count",  vjust = 1.5, colour = "white",
             fontface = "bold",size = 7)+
   facet_grid(cols = vars(condition),labeller = label_both)+
   theme_minimal()  +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#808080", "#B3B6B7"))+
   ggtitle("Heart Diseases Frequency for Sexes")+
   theme(
      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
      axis.text.x =  element_text(size = 12, color = "black") ,
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 17),
      legend.position = "none") 
```

Here, we can verify that more than to third of the data set is composed of males and that the incidence of heart disease in males is far greater than it is in females.
</br>

```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 3'}
                      
ggplot(heart_named,aes(age, fill= condition)) +
   geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),breaks=seq(29, 80, by=1), color="grey17") +
   facet_wrap(~condition, ncol=1,scale="fixed") +
   theme_clean()+
   scale_fill_manual(values =c("#808080", "#B3B6B7"))+
   scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(29, 80, by=5))+
   xlab("Age") +
   ylab("Density") +
   ggtitle("Age Histogram")+
   theme(
         plot.title = element_text(size = 17),
         strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
         legend.position = "none") 
```

We see that age plays an important role in increasing the risk of having heart disease. The incidences of positive (disease) starts to increase at the age of 53, peaking at the age of 57, then it starts decreasing until the age of 62. Most people who are suffering are of the age of 57, followed by 56.

</br>

```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 4'}


ggplot(heart_named,aes(blood_pressure, fill=condition)) +
   geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth = 1, color="grey17") +
   geom_density(alpha=.1, fill="black")+
   facet_wrap(~condition, ncol=1,scale="fixed") +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(94.0, 200.0, by=10))+
   theme_clean()   +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#808080", "#B3B6B7")) +
   xlab("Blood Pressure") +
   ylab("Density") +
   ggtitle("Resting Blood Pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)")+
   theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size = 15),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
      legend.position = "none") 
```

Although, it is well known that, over time, hypertension can damage the arteries that feed the heart. The distribution between the two groups appears to be quite similar. It does not indicate any pattern that suggests that the group with the disease has higher blood pressure. Except, for the incidence of some outliers.

</br>
```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 5'}

ggplot(heart_named, aes(y = heart_rate, fill =condition))+
   geom_boxplot()+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#808080", "#B3B6B7")) +
   scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(70.0, 200.0, by=10))+
   theme_minimal()+
   ggtitle("Distributions Max Heart Rate achieved")+
   theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size = 15)) 
```


```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 5.1'}

ggplot(heart_named, aes( heart_rate, fill =condition))+
   geom_density(alpha= .5)+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#404040", "#B3B6B7")) +
   theme_minimal()+
   ggtitle("Distributions Max Heart Rate achieved")+
   theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size = 15)) 

```
We can see from Figures 5 and 5.1 that healthier people have a higher heart rate in comparison with people who have heart disease. Although the distribution of both groups is normal, we can identify that the spread of the distribution for the people with a detected problem is more spread with a lower mean.

</br>

```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 6'}

ggplot(heart_named, aes(y = oldpeak, fill =condition))+
   geom_boxplot()+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#808080", "#B3B6B7")) +
   theme_minimal()+
   ggtitle("Distribution of ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest")  

```





```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 6.1'}

ggplot(heart_named, aes( oldpeak, fill =condition))+
   geom_density(alpha= .5)+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#404040", "#B3B6B7")) +
   theme_minimal()+
   ggtitle("Distribution of ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest")

```

We can identify in Figures 6 and 6.1 an opposite pattern from Figures 5 and 5.1. Here healthier people have a lower oldpeak, in comparison with people who have heart disease. The spread of the distribution remains more spread for the people with a detected problem.

</br>

```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 7'}

ggplot(heart_named,aes(chestpain, fill=condition)) +
   geom_bar(stat="count") +
   geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = -.5, colour = "black",
             fontface = "bold" )+
   facet_grid(cols = vars(condition), labeller = label_both)+
   theme_minimal()  +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#808080", "#B3B6B7"))+
   ggtitle("Bar Chart of Chest Pain Type for Condition")+
   theme(
      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),
      axis.text.x=element_text(angle=35, hjust=1, vjust=1.2, color="black"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 17),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
      legend.position = "none")
```
The predominant chest pain experienced by the group with a heart problem is asymptomatic. While in the other group. It is non-anginal pain. 

</br>
```{r, fig.cap = 'Figure 8'}

ggplot(heart_named,aes(thal, fill=condition)) +
   geom_bar(stat="count") +
   geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = -.2, colour = "black",
             fontface = "bold", size = 4)+
   facet_grid(cols = vars(condition), labeller = label_both)+
   theme_minimal()  +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#808080", "#B3B6B7"))+
   ggtitle("Blood Disorder Thalassemia")+
   theme(
      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),
      axis.text.x=element_text(angle=35, hjust=1, vjust=1.1, color="black"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 17),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
      legend.position = "none")
```
We can see that only roughly 21% of the people with a healthy heart do not have abnormality caused by Thalassemia. However, in the other group, almost 73% present abnormality.

</br>


```{r, message=FALSE,, fig.cap = 'Figure 9'}

ggplot(heart_named, aes(age, blood_pressure, color = condition))+ 
   geom_point(size = 4, alpha= 0.6)+
   scale_color_manual(values = c("#A0A0A0", "black"))+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#808080", "#B3B6B7"))+
   facet_grid(cols = vars(sex))+
   geom_smooth(method = "lm",se =FALSE )+
   theme_minimal()  +
   ggtitle("Relationship Between Age and Blood Pressure")+
   theme(
      axis.text.x=element_text( color="black"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 17),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14))

```
We can see that age and blood pressure are positively correlated. As we saw in figure 3 the spread of blood pressure remains quite similar for men. However, by separating the groups by gender, we are able to verify that blood pressure changes for women. Women with heart disease tend to have higher blood pressure.

</br>


```{r, message=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Figure 10'}

ggplot(heart_named, aes(age, heart_rate, color = condition))+
   geom_point(size = 4, alpha= 0.6)+
   scale_color_manual(values = c("#A0A0A0", "black"))+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#black", "#black"))+
   facet_grid(cols = vars(sex))+
   geom_smooth(method = "lm",se =FALSE )+
   theme_minimal()  +
   ggtitle("Relationship Between Age and Blood Pressure")+
   theme(
      axis.text.x=element_text( color="black"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 17),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14))

```
We can see that age and heart rate are negatively correlated except for the group of women with heart disease that is positively correlated. As we get older, our hearts tend to decrease heart rate. Though, for women with abnormalities in the heart, it tends to increase.

###Splitting Data

 The sample will be done using 75% of the observations for training and 
25% for testing the model. The variables were selected based on the data analyses.

```{r}
heart_data_2 <- heart_named %>%
   select(chestpain,thal,major_vessel,heart_rate,oldpeak,blood_pressure,
          condition,age,sex)

n <- nrow(heart_data_2)

n_train <- round(0.74 * n)

train_indices <- sample(1:n, n_train)

train <- heart_data_2[train_indices, ]

Confusion matrix of predictions from the test set(GBM):
```{r}
f <- table(test$condition,test$target_pred)
t.df<-as.data.frame(f)


ggplot(data = t.df, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, label=Freq)) +
   geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq)) +
   scale_fill_gradient(low="#E0E0E0" , high= "#808080") +
   theme_minimal() +
   xlab("Actual Heart Disease") +
   ylab("Predicted Heart Disease") +
   geom_text(size=8) +
   ggtitle("Gradient Boosting Machine")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = as.factor(test$target_pred),         
                reference = as.factor(test$condition))
```

Plot of the ROC curve (GBM):
```{r}
 ROC <- suppressMessages(roc(ifelse(test$target_pred == "disease", 1,0),
            ifelse(test$condition   == "disease", 1,0)))
 
 # Plot the ROC curve
 plot(ROC, col = "black")
 
 # Calculate the area under the curve (AUC)
 auc(ROC)

#Conclusion

Among the algorithms applied to predict the incidence of heart disease, the Logistic Regression performed better with 90% of accuracy on its predictions.

The number of people affected by heart  diseases is increasing day by day so it is very important to have a method to detect even the subtle patterns which point out a problem in the heart. With the help of machine learning models we can identify who suffers from these diseases from the patterns on the data. This way increasing the odds for possible early treatment and healthier life.
